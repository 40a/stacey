 *	----------------
 *
 *	This text file is used to generate a site structure into your /content folder
 *	Keep in mind that stacey will only allow for two levels of depth (ie. /content/projects/project)
 *	It should follow this format: 
 *	
 *	project-url/project.txt: Project Page Name
 *  - child-page-url/project.txt: Child Page
 *	index/index.txt
 *	
 *
 *	WARNING
 *	Any files which already exist within /content will be deleted
 *	For security reasons, the /app/generate/generate.txt file should be renamed to _generate.txt once it has been run and your content structure has been created
